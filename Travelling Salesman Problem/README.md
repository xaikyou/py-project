# TRAVELLING SALESMAN PROBLEM
Given the number of vertices at random position [0..100, 0..100]. Start from vertex 0. Find the shortest possible route that visits each vertex exactly once and returns to the origin vertex.
The code above uses the Prim's Algorithm based on The Coding Train's video to solve this problem and will show the result through a graph using Matplotlib
